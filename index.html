    <p class="text-center">
      A croissant (US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/) is a buttery, flaky, French
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named
      for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter,
      rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
      sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
      flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
