    (US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/) 
    </br> 
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. 
  
      Croissants are named
      for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter,
      rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
      sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
      flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
